made to replicate an official help page of a company. I made

the display logo button. The color and font buttons allow the 
user to customize the text they input in the text box and

the user's body mass index according to the inputted information. The user 
types in his/her's height and weight to calculate the BMI. The equation is: 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. The program also 
keeps track of how many people calculated their BMI and the average of the 
total people's BMI.</td>

<td>Craps Game (Dice Roll)</td>
<td class="justified">The Craps Game program is a replica of the real Craps game 
played in casinos. The object of the game is fairly simple after you learn it once. 
If the first roll of the die luckily rolls to a total of 7, then the player immediately 
wins. If the total is a 2, 3, or 12 on the first roll, then the player loses. If it isn't 
any of the previous numbers, the program will put a 'point' on that number. A point in 
this game is like a marker. Continuing the rolls after getting a point on a number, if 
the die rolls a sum of the number with the marker, the player wins. If the die rolls to a 
7 after the first roll, then the player loses.<a name="CG"></td>
