character has to survive as long as it can to get as much points as it can. The character will lose if it hits 
either the bottom or the top of the game. The platforms will continuously move upwards, so the character has 
to drop through the holes in the platform to stay alive. Items will randomly appear that will either help or 
setback your character: slow, stun, points, steal, fast, and obstacles.</td>
